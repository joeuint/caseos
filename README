                            caseos - A risc-v toy OS

Caseos is a monolithic kernel for the risc-v architecture. It's currently only
supported on the QEMU virt board. It's not intended for production use.

== License ==
This project is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 2 or
later. See COPYING for details.

== Documentation ==
Consult the doc/ directory for documentation. All documentation is written in
markdown.

== Building ==
You need a risc-v cross compiler and binutils to build the kernel. You can get
these tools from the risc-v foundation. You also need QEMU to run the kernel.

Run `make` to build the kernel binary. However, you it is recommended that you
use the provided machine by running `make qemu` which will build the binary AND
run it through QEMU. `make debugqemu` will allow you to debug the kernel using
gdb remotely via port :3333 (or port specified in the Makefile). Setting the env
DEBUG=1 during build-time will enable debug output. Changes will only apply upon
recompiliation. Run `make clean` to clean up all objects and binaries.

== Running ==
Run `make qemu` to run the kernel in QEMU.

== Contributing ==
All patches must be connected to a real identity, and signed off. By making a
contribution, you are agreeing to the Developer Certificate of Origin. See
https://developercertificate.org/ for more information.

== Credits ==
Both the RISC-V barebones from OS Dev and xv6 were helpful to the development of
this project. I mostly tried to implement everything myself.
