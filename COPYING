START EXCEPTION TERMS

For greater certainty, the license does not cover user programs that interact
with the kernel via "syscalls". They are considered normal use and do not have
to abide by the license set by this project.

END EXCEPTION TERMS

This exception was added to hopefully address any ambinguity behind syscalls,
even though it should be obvious that they are not the same as "Derived Work".

All contributions are subject to these terms.
