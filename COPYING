START EXCEPTION TERMS

1. For greater certainty, use of syscalls in a user program does not, by itself,
constitute copying or conveying of the software under the license. Use of
syscalls is permitted without obligations or restrictions under the license.

2. The use of syscalls also does not provide an exemption from compliance with
the the license. All terms of the license still apply, even with the exception
in force.

3. This exception does not imply that all user programs are exempt from licence
restrictions and obligations.

END EXCEPTION TERMS

This exception was added to hopefully address any ambinguity behind syscalls,
even though it should be obvious that they are not the same as "Derived Work".

All contributions are subject to these terms.
