2 or (at your option) any later version. See doc/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt for the
license text of the GPL v2.0. However, the following exception applies the
GPL-2.0:

START EXCEPTION TERMS

1. For greater certainty, use of syscalls in a user program does not, by itself,
constitute copying or conveying of the software under the license. Use of
syscalls is permitted without obligations or restrictions under the license.

2. The use of syscalls also does not provide an exemption from compliance with
the other terms of the license. All terms of the license still apply, even with
the exception in force.

END EXCEPTION TERMS

All software documentation including but not limited to the doc/ directory is
licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License v1.3 or later
(GFDL-1.3-or-later).  See doc/licenses/fdl-1.3.txt for the license text of the
GFDL v1.3.

This exception was added to hopefully address any ambinguity behind syscalls,
even though it should be obvious that they are not the same as "Derived Work".

All contributions are subject to these terms.
